Randomly group people together to get a meal together, and send an email to everyone to tell them what their group is!

## Prerequisites
As described [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python), set up a Google Cloud project, enable the Gmail API, and create credentials for a desktop application. Store the credentials JSON file as `client_secret.json` in your working directory as you run `MealBot.py`.

You will also need to use pip to install a couple of modules that may not already be installed on your machine:

```
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
pip install --upgrade oauth2client
```

Finally, set up `Message.txt` and `PersonList.txt` as described in `MealBot.py`.
