Beep boop!

Welcome back from winter break! In case you didn't get the chance to join last semester, I wanted to give everyone the chance to join again at the start of this semester (or any other time throughout the semester that you want to join).

Meal Bot is a service that matches you with a random person in YSC to have a meal with! It's a great way to meet new people and make new friends, as well as get the chance to have a longer, focused conversation than you might normally have at a large or small group. You can sign up at http://tinyurl.com/YSCMealbot2023. (If you signed up last semester, you don't need to sign up again.)

We will be starting up Meal Bot again on Sunday, January 21st!

For those of you who have reflected and decided that now is not the right season for Meal Bot, feel free to opt out by editing your form response at http://tinyurl.com/YSCMealbot2023.

Have a great first day of classes!
